## Misc add
directory = always WorkSpace directory here


#   - if you *create* IP ACGs, you don't know the 'id' yet.
#     Leave "placeholder" as is.
#   - if you update existing IP ACGs, technically the existing IP ACG
#     will be disassciated from the directory, and deleted, before
#     a new IP ACG will be created.
# -> at update possible to keep, right?

# dry run for validating settings.yaml
