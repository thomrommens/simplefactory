# ip_acgs

# - 'name'
#   - if you specify multiple IP ACGs, make sure you use unique names.
#     - in case of updating an IP ACGs, the program looks up 
#       the id of the existing, targeted IP ACGs, by using their name.

# - 'rules'
#    - specify a maximum of 10 rules.
#    - a single rule can be a *single* IP address (prefix /32),
#        or a *range* of IP addresses (prefix lower than /32). 
#    - if no prefix is set, each rule will be automatically appended with 
#       the prefix for a single IP address, i.e.,'/32'. 
#    - set rules smartly using a prefix if you want to 
#       cover multiple IP addresses within one group, e.g., add '/27'.
#       - use https://www.cidr.xyz for a quick insight.
#    - the program will append '/32' to a single IP address, if not done so
#      also. Note that this can cause a duplicate.

# - Update properties of the suggested IP ACGs that you want to apply 
#   to each AWS directory, below.
#   - An IP ACG id is never specified;
#     - at creation of new IP ACGs, you do not know it upfront;
#     - at update of existing IP ACGs, technically the configuration in this
#       document will just be recreated (not actually updated), with new
#       IP ACG ids.

# - Add extra ACGs by copy-pasting the suggested items:
#   - each ACG is a new dictionary, indicated by a hyphen, 
#     in the list of 'ip_acgs';
#   - use the same properties as the suggested IP ACGs;
#   - enclose all content with double quotes.
